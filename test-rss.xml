										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget-minded entrepreneurs and early-stage startup founders take heed — this is no time to procrastinate. We have only 20 early-bird tickets left for </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch Early Stage 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in San Francisco on April 14.</span></p>
<p><b>Move it or lose it:</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/?promo=eblastchancepostapr4&amp;display=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy a $249 founder pass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and save $200. Once they’re gone, the price goes up to $449.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/?promo=eblastchancepostapr4">TC Early Stage</a> is all about helping new startup founders (pre-seed through Series A) learn the essential skills required to build a successful business. No need to reinvent the startup wheel — you’ll have access to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/?promo=eblastchancepostapr4#b22619b6-8576-4461-ba7f-2eb0e5082ceb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading experts across a range of specialties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2292794" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this one-day startup bootcamp, you’ll learn about legal issues, fundraising, marketing, growth, product-market fit, usage-based pricing, pitch decks, recruiting and more. We’re talking more than 40 highly engaging presentations, workshops with interactive Q&amp;As, roundtables and plenty of time for networking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are just a few examples of the topics we have on tap. You’ll find plenty more listed in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2022/?promo=roundtablerounduppostmar23#a4189c79-f7f6-43ce-89bb-5cc1b32e3ec3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the event agenda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Playbook for Startup Brand Building:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Building your brand at the early stages of company building is critical but often overlooked and misunderstood. A brand is more than a logo and a website; it’s the story that reflects your values and vision, guides every touchpoint and communication, and sparks connection and emotion. Brands are participatory, so you create your own brand story at launch, but others define it as you grow. Learn the building blocks of developing a compelling brand story that wins hearts and minds while supporting your company’s growth.</span></p>
<p><b>How to Talk Business When You’re a Technical Founder: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to pitching early-stage enterprise startups, technical founders can sometimes neglect the business side of the conversation. To help build your confidence in “talking business,” DTC’s Ryan Wexler will cover the fundamentals of what investors want to hear about how you’ll transform your technology into a fundamentally important business.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>Why Raising Venture Capital Benefits Startups:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fundraising is a critical phase of any startup’s life, but it’s also a challenging task and hard to do successfully. The truth is, the amount of money that a startup raises – and how the startup does it – plays a major role in the company’s future trajectory. Given the many sources of capital available, it is smart to understand how corporate venture capital can be a successful model for startups and corporate investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s another big benefit to buying your pass right now. You’ll receive </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/28/networking-with-crunchmatch-starts-today-for-techcrunch-early-stage/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to CrunchMatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our AI-powered networking platform, and start connecting with TC Early Stage attendees right now, before the event begins.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peanut</a>, a social networking app for women, is launching a new &#8220;Peanut Pro&#8221; expansion designed to give women access to information from trusted experts. The company has partnered with 100 experts from its existing network, including doulas, psychologists, therapists, sex coaches and sleep consultants. Peanut is also launching a new tipping feature that will allow experts and creators on the platform to monetize their work.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, Peanut is an online community that is designed to connect women throughout all stages of their lives, from puberty to menopause. The app currently has more than 2.5 million users. Peanut provides access to a community of women who are part of the network to share information and offer advice.</p>
<p>The new Pro offering works by connecting experts with women and helping them build their own networks on the Peanut app. The experts will connect with women on the platform through group discussions, live audio content and one-on-one direct messages. Users on the app can then send tips to the experts during these interactions. In the future, Peanut plans to launch monthly subscriptions that will give members access to exclusive content.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293181" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Michelle Kennedy, the founder and CEO of Peanut, told TechCrunch that the goal of Peanut Pro is to &#8220;democratize access to expertise.&#8221; Kennedy notes that the expertise may be formal, and through a therapist or psychologist. In other cases, the expertise may be experience-led through someone with a public profile who has gathered a wealth of information on a specific topic. The company also wants to break down economic barriers that women may face when trying to access experts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2293191" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2293191" class=" wp-image-2293191" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png" alt="peanut chat" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2293191" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Peanut</p></div></p>
<p>“We want to break down huge fees into manageable, accessible subscriptions and one-off payments,” Kennedy said. “Not everyone can afford $200 to for one-on-one consultations across sleep training or sex therapy, so if we instead provide access to short form Q&amp;As or online courses, suddenly support is decentralized. And, whilst we do that, women with expertise, our Pros, get paid regularly, with less invisible labor because their content is valued.”</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Kennedy outlined that the next step for the company is to introduce online courses and paywalled content via its upcoming monthly membership.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“A lot of the women with expertise who already use Peanut to share advice and support have their own online courses. Until now, they have been unable to share them with our audience due to our guidelines on advertising businesses and services. Peanut Pro permits women to share their content and courses with our audience and ultimately, monetize their hard work,” she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2293192" style="width: 565px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2293192" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2293192" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png" alt="" width="555" height="555" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chat-Tipping.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2293192" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Peanut</p></div></p>
<p>Peanut has been adding new features and enhancing its product over the past few years. Last year, the company launched<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/social-network-peanut-expands-to-include-more-women-with-launch-of-peanut-menopause/"> “Peanut Menopause,”</a> a dedicated space in the app where women can meet others who are at a similar life stage — whether that’s other premenopausal, menopausal or postmenopausal women. Peanut also added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/social-networking-app-for-women-peanut-adds-live-audio-rooms/">live audio rooms</a> last year as a way for women on its app to have better connections in a more supportive, safer environment than other social audio platforms may provide.</p>
<p>The company has raised $23 million in funding to date. Most recently, Peanut <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/social-network-for-women-peanut-raises-12m-series-a-amid-pandemic/">announced the close</a> of a $12 million Series A round of funding in May 2020. The round was led by EQT Ventures, a multi-stage VC firm that invests in companies across Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>Kennedy noted Peanut&#8217;s long-term vision is to serve women at every life stage so that three women in the same family at varying stages of womanhood can all find community and support on the app. The company plans to introduce more experts onto the platform to cater to more needs. Peanut is already seeing requests from women for access to information across topics like financial health, legal support and more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AMD is in the chip business, and a big part of that these days involves operating in data centers at an enormous scale.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://amd.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD</a> is in the chip business, and a big part of that these days involves operating in data centers at an enormous scale. As the scale increases, efficiency becomes paramount, and being able to maximize efficiency for specific workloads becomes more critical.</p>
<p>AMD announced today that it intends to acquire data center optimization startup <a href="http://pensando.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pensando</a> for approximately $1.9 billion. The company&#8217;s products include a programmable packet processor that manages how workloads move through the hardware infrastructure, moving work off of the CPU whenever possible to increase performance. The company claims between 8x and 13x better performance than competitive products from companies like Nutanix, VMware, Cisco and others.</p>
<p>AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su said that the acquisition is about helping data center operators lower the cost of ownership by using software to squeeze out every last bit of efficiency.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293466" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Today, with our acquisition of Pensando, we add a leading distributed services platform to our high-performance CPU, GPU, FPGA and adaptive SoC portfolio. The Pensando team brings world-class expertise and a proven track record of innovation at the chip, software and platform level,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>Pensando CEO and co-founder Prem Jain framed the deal in terms of being able to grow faster inside the larger organization than it could on its own. &#8220;Joining together with AMD will help accelerate growth in our core business and enable us to pursue a much larger customer base across more markets,&#8221; he said. Jain will join the data center solutions group at AMD when the deal closes.</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategies, who keeps a close watch on the chip industry, said that this gives AMD a key set of software tooling inside data centers. &#8220;NPUs (neural processing units) and IPUs (infrastructure processing unit) perform network offload so that the server can provide a consistent level of performance for applications. While the solution requires chips and cards, the framework is all software defined,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Overall, Moorhead said it&#8217;s a good acquisition for AMD, giving the company capabilities it lacked. &#8220;This gets AMD into the NPU or IPU market. It will compete with Intel, Nvidia and Marvell. Pensando has a very good array of enterprise and cloud customers. I like it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2017 and has raised over $300 million from companies like Lightspeed Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, according to Crunchbase data. Customers include Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud and Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>The exact price of this deal will be worked out when they determine working capital and other adjustments from Pensando, according to AMD. Nonetheless, the deal is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to customary regulatory review.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Musk-Twitter saga is a reminder that tech can still be silly and fun. But I have to admit that I liked it more when the silly and fun came more from early-stage founders than late-stage billionaires.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It must be slightly intoxicating to be able to move markets. Imagine if your latest purchase of a stock or token sent the value of that security soaring simply because it became known that <em>you</em> made the trade.</p>
<p>Such is the case with Elon Musk and Twitter. As TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/04/musk-twitter-shares-trolled-again/">reported this morning</a>, the well-known technology entrepreneur &#8220;has taken a 9.2% share of the company, working out to around $2.9 billion based on Friday’s share price.&#8221; In response to Musk&#8217;s disclosure that he had purchased so much of the U.S. social network, shares of Twitter are up 24.6% as I write to you this morning.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>For Twitter, the Musk purchase is providing it with billions of dollars in new market cap, meaning that the social company is at once harder to take over and more able to execute M&amp;A given that it has more value to throw around. Hell, the share-price bump, should it persist, is effectively a raise for Twitter&#8217;s staff, perhaps limiting human churn amid a tight labor market.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Unless Musk gets wild with his Twitter stake, he just gave the company a pretty nice gift.</p>
<p>But folks rarely drop a few billion dollars for fun &#8212; Musk likely has a set of goals in mind for his nearly 10% stake in Twitter. But at least he didn&#8217;t decide to build his own vanity social network.</p>
<h2>Taking Twitter on</h2>
<p>Apart from TikTok, the field of new social networks feels somewhat thin. And those that have clawed their way to market share have generally done so by taking a new tack on digital human interaction over a rehash of what worked before. TikTok made it by focusing on short-form videos and music, just as Twitter blew up with micro-posts. Instagram had a good idea with feeds of images. You get the idea.</p>
<p>Rare is the copycat success, at least in recent years, especially among startups looking to ape a winning model. A good example of that fact is the regular attempts to replace Twitter. Remember Mastodon? Probably not. More recently, have you used Gettr, Truth Social, or Parler or Gab? Probably not. And yet there are a host of companies trying to replicate Twitter&#8217;s magic.</p>
<p>Musk had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/28/elon-musk-tweets-social-media-twitter/">mused in March</a> about a new social network after posting some unlearned criticisms of how Twitter is managing its own service. But instead of buying something smaller, or building something new, Musk bought Twitter stock. What <em>now</em>?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Demonstrating that there&#8217;s a robust market for contract management solutions, <a href="https://linksquares.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkSquares</a>, a company developing intelligent software that helps brands maintain and ink new contracts, today announced that it raised $100 million in series C financing led by G Squared. The tranche, which had participation from new investor G2 Venture Partners as well as existing backers, brings the startup&#8217;s total funding to $161.4 million at an $800 million valuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this new investment, we will continue to grow our business with in-house legal teams, continue to grow our presence in international markets, like Canada, the U.K. and Australia, [and build a] multi-product suite that expands beyond contract lifecycle management into other use cases for in-house legal teams,&#8221; CEO Vishal Sunak told TechCrunch via email. &#8220;[We] think that &#8230; there’s an opportunity to build more products that the entire legal team can use in areas like intellectual property management, outside counsel, [and] governance risk compliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, LinkSquares was inspired by Sunak&#8217;s and Chris Combs&#8217; work with contracts and due diligence over the course of a company acquisition. Combs was leading business development at Backupify when it was acquired by data backup company Datto, now owned by Vista Equity Partners, in 2015, while Sunak was serving as Datto&#8217;s operations director.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2291369" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;During that time, it was all hands on deck as [Backupify] lined everything up to support the acquisition,&#8221; Sunak explained. &#8220;Datto hoped to migrate Backupify’s customer data to their cloud infrastructure. However, one obstacle to this business goal was to understand each individual signed customer contract, and determine if Datto had the right to move the data without permission. The idea to review each contract, read the provision related to data transfer, and store the answer seemed straightforward &#8212; at first. In reality, because Backupify had negotiated more than 2,000 contracts, the act of finding all the contracts and looking for the provision language was an impossible undertaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it turned out, Backupify wasn&#8217;t the only company struggling to surface insights from its contractual agreements. <a href="https://www.icertis.com/blog/worldcc-benchmark-report/">According</a> to World Commerce &amp; Contracting, nearly 40% of organizations don&#8217;t have a clear idea of who&#8217;s responsible for their contracts internally. Unaffiliated, earlier research from the Blickstein Group suggests that most organizations track only basic contract management metrics like volume by customer, partner, program type and geography.</p>
<p>Combs and Sunak sought with LinkSquares to build a platform that combines legal analysis with sophisticated contract lifecycle capabilities. Leveraging AI and &#8220;the expertise of top legal customers,&#8221; LinkSquares helps companies to write contracts, analyze what&#8217;s in existing documents and collaborate with other teams across the organization, Sunak says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2292862" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2292862" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2292862" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/02_LinkSquares-Drafting-Contract_inscreen2.png" alt="LinkSquares" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/02_LinkSquares-Drafting-Contract_inscreen2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/02_LinkSquares-Drafting-Contract_inscreen2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/02_LinkSquares-Drafting-Contract_inscreen2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/02_LinkSquares-Drafting-Contract_inscreen2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/02_LinkSquares-Drafting-Contract_inscreen2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/02_LinkSquares-Drafting-Contract_inscreen2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/02_LinkSquares-Drafting-Contract_inscreen2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2292862" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LinkSquares</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In-house legal brings a unique skill set to a company that has real value to stakeholders up and down the corporate ladder, but they are often viewed as the company bottleneck. Modern legal teams need to cement their seat at the executive-level. In order to do this, they need to have consistent and accurate data at their fingertips,&#8221; Sunak said. &#8220;[L]egal teams have needs outside of contract lifecycle management, too, and are often forced into siloed single-use products that don’t integrate with other company business systems which creates major challenges for adoption, usage and data flow.&#8221;</p>
<p>LinkSquares offers post-signature analytics and a searchable repository for contracts, allowing companies to use AI to extract both contract data and metadata. Sunak claims that the platform, which is has processed more than four million documents and over 100 million unique data points to date, can yield roughly 115 answers to contract metadata in 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Beyond this, LinkSquares integrates with services from Salesforce, Adobe, DocuSign and HelloSign and will next week gain an in-house e-signature solution, LinkSquares Sign, to deliver &#8220;full end-to-end&#8221; contract lifecycle management.</p>
<p>&#8220;For our contract lifecycle management product, our pretrained contract metadata extraction technology runs immediately without any training required by the user &#8230; We aim to have more than 250 out-of-the-box extraction values by year-end,&#8221; Sunak added. &#8220;Additionally, we have now &#8230; benchmarks on what is being negotiated in real-time by our customers and really interesting trend data about the usage of certain provisions, language and clauses, which we’re excited to be publishing later this year and even putting this into our product as a way for legal teams to better understand their positioning in negotiations.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Growing market</h2>
<p>Gartner projects that legal department budgets allotted to technology will increase threefold by 2025. Already, 2021 was a record year for legal tech, with $1.4 billion invested by venture capital firms in the first half of the year &#8212; more than in the entirety of 2020 and well above what was raised in 2018 and 2019, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/legal-tech-venture-investment/">according</a> to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>LinkSquares &#8212; which has 550 customers including DraftKings, Igloo and Wayfair &#8212; hit over $20 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in 2021, Sunak claims. The plan is to grow ARR 150% by the end of 2022 and double LinkSquares&#8217; workforce to 500 employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe LinkSquares is well-positioned to address this critical need with what we view to be market-leading proprietary AI. We see the company’s success to date has stemmed from its best-in-class financial metrics and win rates,&#8221; Spencer McLeod, G Squared partner and head of research, told TechCrunch. &#8220;The management team has the vision to transform this space and we believe that through continued execution and product innovation, LinkSquares can redefine how modern legal teams operate.”</p>
<p>But legal tech spending and investments don&#8217;t necessarily correlate with adoption. For example, according to a 2020 American Bar Association <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/advertising/article/why-are-many-firms-still-reluctant-to-implement-legal-technology">study</a>, only 58% of firms use cloud-based data storage while just 7% use tools employing AI (e.g., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/contractpodai/">ContractPodAI</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/08/cognitiv-is-using-ai-for-contract-analysis-and-tracking/">Cognitiv+</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/sirionlabs-raises-44m-to-scale-its-contract-management-software/">SirionLabs</a>).</p>
<p>Hurdles to tech deployment in the legal field have historically included time constraints, cost concerns and a lack of commitment to skills training. Firm administrators are inclined to view any non-billable activity, like training, as a waste of time. Sunak himself acknowledges that over the past decade or so, contract lifecycle management vendors have provided a poor purchasing experience.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all to say that software like LinkSquares isn&#8217;t a silver bullet. Effective contract management requires improving internal processes and fostering &#8212; or bolstering &#8212; employees&#8217; relevant skills. Only then can improvements to contract value be realized through cost reduction and revenue enhancements &#8212; a message LinkSquares will have to communicate clearly as it looks to retain and grow its customer base.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Vendors have sold] feature-bloated products, complex implementations, [and an] overemphasis on pre-signature workflows as the solution for every contract management problem,&#8221; Sunak said. &#8220;[But we&#8217;re] seeing a lot of wind getting into the sails now and in the years to come as forecasted &#8230; The [contract lifecycle management space] has a lot of activity, which is very positive. Legal tech and contract management specifically is a hot space and it is great to see contract management and contract lifecycle management being pillared by companies like DocuSign and Icertis.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.

<p>After last weeks super startup-heavy show, we were back to our regular Monday grab-bag of news! Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293453" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>A strong start to the week from global stocks, and a general updraft to crypto prices in recent days.</li>
<li>Elon Musk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/04/musk-twitter-shares-trolled-again/">buying a huge stake in Twitter</a>, the popular American social network. The move comes after the Tesla and SpaceX CEO tweeted that Twitter was not allowing enough free discourse. Naturally we look forward to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/28/elon-musk-tweets-social-media-twitter/">yet another idealist learning about content moderation</a>, but we&#8217;re also tracking Twitter rivals, making the situation both complex, and entertaining.</li>
<li>PrimeBlock is going public via a SPAC! The deck hadn&#8217;t dropped in time for the show, but the initial release <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/04/01/2414730/0/en/PRIMEBLOCK-AN-INFRASTRUCTURE-PROVIDER-FOR-BLOCKCHAIN-TECHNOLOGY-THAT-MINES-CRYPTOCURRENCIES-AND-10X-CAPITAL-VENTURE-ACQUISITION-CORP-II-ANNOUNCE-PLANNED-MERGER.html">is here</a>.</li>
<li>From the rest: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/02/tesla-delivers-record-number-of-evs-in-exceptionally-difficult-quarter/">Tesla deliveries were hot</a>, <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/140359/stock-trading-api-startup-lemon-markets-raises-17-million-in-seed-funding">lemon.markets raised $17 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/04/ups-partners-with-jumia-to-expand-delivery-network-in-africa/">and Jumia is working with UPS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Equity is live this week, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events">swing by to hang out if you want to this Thursday</a>. Else we are back on a regular cadence!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is testing a new &#8220;Featured Curators&#8221; feature that promotes popular user playlists alongside its official Spotify playlists, the company <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-04-04/three-things-to-know-about-spotifys-featured-curators-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Monday. The new feature is part of a limited-time test that is designed to amplify the playlists that users create on Spotify. The feature is also a way for listeners to discover more music on the platform.</p>
<p>The company says the curators it has selected for this feature are music lovers with established followings and popular playlists on Spotify. Users in select markets will start to see Featured Curator playlists recommended in-app and on their homepages. Spotify plans to tweak the new feature throughout the testing period.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is always to make Spotify the number one destination for the best listening experience, and with this pilot, we’re giving listeners a new way to discover music from fellow fans who are as engaged as they are,&#8221; the company said in a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-04-04/three-things-to-know-about-spotifys-featured-curators-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> about the announcement. &#8220;We’re always testing unique and different listening experiences and programs for our fans, and we’re excited to watch this one unfold.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293460" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new feature should make it easier it to discover the numerous popular user-generated playlists on the platform. With this new test, Spotify notes that it&#8217;s experimenting with taking playlist creation and discovery even further following its successful launches of flagship playlists like <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/discoverweekly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discovery Weekly</a>.</p>
<p>The launch of the new test comes a few days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/spotify-expands-its-music-matching-playlist-blend-to-work-with-up-to-10-people-including-select-artists/">Spotify updated</a> its popular playlist creation tool called Blend. The feature currently allows two Spotify users to see where their musical tastes overlap by mixing together their favorite songs to find those they have in common. This Blend then updates daily with new songs based on everyone’s listening habits. Last week, Spotify expanded Blend to allow users to create playlists with up to 10 people, or even with some of their favorite artists.</p>
<p>The company has partnered with several artists, including <a href="https://spotify.link/Qv0VGA2Poob" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://spotify.link/Qv0VGA2Poob&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648733375913000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pzd2WhZQVONU3SV_zraLN">BTS</a>, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/uN3Yj27Roob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4w170MRs$" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/uN3Yj27Roob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4w170MRs$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648733375913000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0thhLCxpEIUGeaNuTR9rb7">Charli XCX</a>, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/tUf2Ca2Roob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4IPlXQhk$" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/tUf2Ca2Roob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4IPlXQhk$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648733375913000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0kscKKqMiaIcdvaPj68tnb">Kacey Musgraves</a>, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/8IARIeWSoob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4qEhn_4E$" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/8IARIeWSoob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4qEhn_4E$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648733375913000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1a59uWpPWe8uJLyW-Em6iA">Lauv</a>, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/UzOMXzpSoob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4aS8krns$" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/UzOMXzpSoob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4aS8krns$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648733375913000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VcAbsq0DL1kchI2VzLxSk">Megan Thee Stallion</a>, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/hMImaPZSoob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4NcQjEWs$" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/hMImaPZSoob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4NcQjEWs$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648733375913000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ZXlinagat4ETvMu5Y8ez5">Mimi Webb</a>, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/C4o2PW4Soob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4C9XvPy0$" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/C4o2PW4Soob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4C9XvPy0$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648733375913000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2h487gJIAbPMvshJfHYNXN">Tai Verdes</a>, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/xn4scNiToob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4LeHckrI$" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/spotify.link/xn4scNiToob__;!!BupLon6U!5pn6TPeq6FYiCGO7YlWqwAOgFO8uTbGCMGyNQBPg1PzyHzuVlEHfqGSKsv223ta4LeHckrI$&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648733375913000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qKv_8KZUUnDZRJ-f8xfZF">Xamã</a> and others to allow Spotify users to merge their musical tastes into a single Blend playlist where their own favorite tracks are matched with those from the artists.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Indian antitrust watchdog ordered a wide-ranging investigation into the conduct of food delivery firms Zomato and Swiggy on Monday over whether they are operating as &#8220;neutral&#8221; following a complaint from the National Restaurant Association of India, a body that represents over 500,000 restaurants in the country.</p>
<p>The Competition Commission of India <a href="http://cci.gov.in/sites/default/files/16-of-2021.pdf">acknowledged a series of allegations</a> (PDF) &#8212; including food delivery firms&#8217; practice of bundling delivery services with customers&#8217; food orders, masking data from restaurant partners, operating cloud kitchens, &#8220;unfair and one-sided contracts&#8221; with the outlets, delayed payment cycle, and charging of exorbitant commission &#8212; and said they are worth probing to see if they violate the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;NRAI has further alleged that OPs are engaging in a dual role on their platform where they list their own cloud kitchen brands exclusively on their platform, akin to private labels, thereby creating an inherent conflict of interest in the platform’s role as an intermediary on one hand and as a participant on the other hand,&#8221; the watchdog described in its order Monday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293459" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>However, the watchdog said it is of view that prima facie &#8220;allegations pertaining to delayed payment cycle, imposition of one-sided clauses in the agreement, charging of exorbitant commission etc. and based on those submissions,&#8221; do not &#8220;seem to have an effect on competition in the facts and circumstances of the present case.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then came the change of heart, just a paragraph later: &#8220;However, as discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, the Commission is of the view that there exists a prima facie case with respect to some of the conduct of Zomato and Swiggy, which requires an investigation by the Director General (‘DG’), to determine whether the conduct of the OPs have resulted in contravention of the provisions of Section 3(1) of the Act read with Section 3(4) thereof, as detailed in this order.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Director General has been directed to carry out a detailed investigation and submit the findings within 60 days, the CCI said.</p>
<p>The investigation is only the latest headache for the food delivery firms. Zomato, which has been performing poorly on the public market, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/21/zomato-10-minute-food-delivery/">exploring entering instant food delivery</a>, a category that is bound to further complicate its relationship with restaurant partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Swiggy, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/indian-food-delivery-giant-swiggy-raises-700-million-at-10-7-billion-valuation/">valued at $10.7 billion in its Series K financing</a> in January this year, is looking to raise as much as $1 billion in the IPO, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/08/swiggy-ipo/">reported earlier</a>.</p>
<p>India’s food services market is expected to reach $97 billion by March 2026, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report to clients last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">He&#8217;s used Twitter to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-59243606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll people</a> apparently to make major business decisions. He&#8217;s had his hand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/26/elon-musk-sec-agree-to-guidelines-on-twitter-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">figuratively slapped</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/22/us-regulators-say-someone-really-needs-to-monitor-elon-musks-tweets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than once</a>) by regulators over how he&#8217;s used the social platform to potentially manipulate the markets. And he&#8217;s even said he&#8217;s wanted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/28/elon-musk-tweets-social-media-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build a social platform of his own</a>, since owning a digital mouthpiece seems to be the mogul&#8217;s (and autocrat&#8217;s) current version of having your own super-yacht.</p>
<p>Now Elon Musk is putting some of his money where his mouth has been for years. Today, Twitter <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001418091/f66f56c1-eb52-43f8-a7ff-992dc80a7396.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a note</a> confirming that the SpaceX and Tesla entrepreneur has taken a 9.2% share of the company, working out to around $2.9 billion based on Friday&#8217;s share price.</p>
<p>The confirmation of the share purchase &#8212; which was rumored last week &#8212; sent Twitter&#8217;s stock soaring; it&#8217;s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR?p=TWTR&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently some 23% above its Friday closing price</a> ahead of the opening of the market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293442" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The filing, signed and dated today by Musk, notes that the share event was actually on March 14. Specifically, it noted that he had purchased 73,486,938 shares of common stock on that date.</p>
<p>The date is notable, in that it predates by about 14 days Musk&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1507907130124222471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweets</a> claiming he was giving &#8220;serious thought&#8221; to the idea of starting his own social network. One takeaway is it seems he was teasing the real news here &#8212; his taking a stake in Twitter &#8212; to his base. Once a troll, always a troll.</p>
<p>Since starting a social network from scratch is a long play, and has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-two-key-tech-execs-quit-truth-social-after-troubled-app-launch-2022-04-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absolutely no guarantee to succeed</a>, Musk&#8217;s version of building may be starting now, in the form of building a stake in an already-established company &#8212; a platform where he&#8217;s established himself as a power user, no less.</p>
<p>Those who love Musk have relished the chance on Twitter to tweet at him in hopes of a reply and to religiously follow his words on all things from cryptocurrency and his companies to world affairs. His critics have decried how he apparently manipulates situations, sometimes just for kicks, using the platform. As for Musk himself, he&#8217;s hard to pin down, but largely comes off as Libertarian in his approach. That position is underscored by this new interest that he has taken in being a social media entrepreneur &#8212; not just a user &#8212; with a focus on so-called &#8220;free speech.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some have <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10683927/Elon-Musk-Twitters-biggest-shareholder-taking-9-2-stake-company.html?ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490&amp;ito=1490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that these shares effectively will make Musk Twitter&#8217;s largest sole shareholder. What that might mean for Twitter, for Musk, and for the world of reasonable people who are not fanboys of the guy remains to be seen. We&#8217;ve reached out to the company to confirm that detail and will update when we learn more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The community marketplace for wild and specialty foods provides foragers with a place to sell food items they dig up.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jack Hamrick has been trying to reduce the amount of red meat he eats, but the typical portobello mushroom alternative got boring real quick.</p>
<p>When he began looking around for a wild mushroom called chicken of the woods, he found it hard to buy. That was when he met Andy Conner, a certified mushroom hunter, who was having the opposite problem — difficulty selling 10 pounds of seaweed he found.</p>
<p>Not seeing an option out there — Etsy doesn’t have a category for food, Hamrick said — together they created <a href="https://foraged.market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foraged</a>, a community marketplace for wild and specialty foods, in May 2021 to provide a place for “foragers” to sell the foods they have harvested.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2292929" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hamrick says mushrooms are a $13 billion market and calls Foraged “the Etsy of specialty food.” Indeed, it’s a lucrative market and products on the site run on average between $40 and $50 per pound.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="S4Y7OHKYj1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/yami-bags-50m-series-b-to-boost-its-online-asian-marketplace/">Yami bags $50M Series B to boost its online Asian marketplace </a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Yami bags $50M Series B to boost its online Asian marketplace &#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/yami-bags-50m-series-b-to-boost-its-online-asian-marketplace/embed/#?secret=JxbHwaY15q#?secret=S4Y7OHKYj1" data-secret="S4Y7OHKYj1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However, he doesn’t want you thinking Foraged is some kind of online farmer’s market.</p>
<p>“This is for heirloom and boutique foragers and farmers who want to sell food with a story,” he added. “I saw online farmer’s markets attempted, but it frequently ends up like a subscription box and then fails. We have food artisans who are selling foods and complementary products that you can’t get anywhere else.”</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Foragers apply to sell on the marketplace, and Foraged staff vets them and onboards them, providing a shop and e-commerce tools. The company takes 10% of the cart value for now — the average order value last month was $123 — but as it gets more sophisticated, Hamrick said the company will look at additional ways to bring in revenue.</p>
<p>When Hamrick and Conner first opened up applications, they had 100 people sign on almost immediately to sell. Within a few months, 500 customers were purchasing from the marketplace, ranging from Michelin star and James Beard-awarded chefs to culinary enthusiasts. The site currently averages 20% return-customer purchases.</p>
<p>Since launching, the co-founders were bootstrapping the company, which was good, and forced them to be responsible, Hamrick said. Foraged is growing at 434% quarter over quarter, spent only $3,000 on marketing and is gaining a TikTok following thanks to foragers like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alexisnikole?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexis Nikole</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now that the company has a footprint in 47 states and five countries, Hamrick and Conner have further aspirations for the company, including building a social network/community for mushroom and specialty food enthusiasts like them. Oh, and to eventually pay themselves.</p>
<p>Last September, some investors, including celebrity chef and restaurateur Tom Colicchio and Sam Shank, HotelTonight CEO and head of commercial at Airbnb, infused $200,000 of pre-seed funding into Foraged.</p>
<p>“The natural foods category has ideal conditions to grow a large marketplace: a fragmented set of suppliers who can turn their hobby into a meaningful business and passionate consumers who are seeking new, superior products that come directly from producers,” Shank said via email. “All this, plus an incredible set of founders to execute on this opportunity.”</p>
<p>Colicchio told me that he invests in companies that fit into areas that he is interested in and are providing a solution to a problem. In Foraged’s case, his favorite thing to eat is wild mushrooms — porcini, morel and chanterelle are his faves — but unless someone has a direct connection to a restaurant or sales, it was hard for people to sell them and make a living before Foraged.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2292949" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2292949" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2292949" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Foraged-co-founders-Jack-Hamrick-and-Andy-Conner.jpg" alt="Foraged, Jack Hamrick, Andy Conner" width="1024" height="633" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Foraged-co-founders-Jack-Hamrick-and-Andy-Conner.jpg 1361w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Foraged-co-founders-Jack-Hamrick-and-Andy-Conner.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Foraged-co-founders-Jack-Hamrick-and-Andy-Conner.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Foraged-co-founders-Jack-Hamrick-and-Andy-Conner.jpg?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Foraged-co-founders-Jack-Hamrick-and-Andy-Conner.jpg?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Foraged-co-founders-Jack-Hamrick-and-Andy-Conner.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2292949" class="wp-caption-text">Foraged co-founders Jack Hamrick and Andy Conner. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Foraged</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, he likes working with small family farms and with an idea that not only makes products available to chefs, but to any consumer.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of things out there that are hard to find, for example, sassafras leaves,” Colicchio added. “I would go to Kentucky and get them, but with this website, I don’t have to travel, and it is easy to navigate.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding enabled the company to make its first hire last month to join contractors working on the technology. Hamrick also wants to create some custom packaging options for sellers to standardize the offerings while also enabling brands to keep their uniqueness.</p>
<p>“Now that we have more of a budget, we are focused on strategic partnerships with influencers in the specialty food space, culinary production and community organization and we will be adding more features,” he added. “The idea is to combine the marketplace with the community so we have a strategic moat.”</p>
<p>With this year’s sales expected to “be gangbusters,” the company plans to do a more formal seed round later this year and go after $5 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wing this morning announced that it is adding Texas to its list of drone delivery markets. On April 7, the Alphabet-owned operation will be arriving in Frisco and Little Elm, a pair of towns in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.</p>
<p>The primary partner is Walgreens, where drones will be picking up health and wellness products. Also on the list is easyvet for pet meds, Texas Health, which provides first aid kits, and Blue Bell Creameries, which is dropping off ice cream as summer looms. Upon launch, the offerings will be available to select customers via invite.</p>
<p>“I do want to set clear expectations: Not everyone who lives within range of our drones will be able to order on Day 1,” says CEO Adam Woodworth. “We’re going to invite customers in groups to make sure everyone has a good first experience with drone delivery.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293243" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Frisco and Little Elm become the second U.S. market and fifth overall currently being served by Wing. They join Christiansburg, Virginia; Helsinki, Finland; and Canberra and Logan, Australia. The pilots are still fairly limited, as Wing grapples with regulations and other roadblocks, though early last month it announced that it had made its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/01/alphabets-wing-drones-hit-200000-delivers-as-it-announces-supermarket-partnership/">200,000th delivery</a>.</p>
<p>The news comes a week after<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/29/flytrex-expands-drone-delivery-into-texas/"> Flytrex announced</a> its own expansion into the Dallas/Fort Worth suburb of Granbury, Texas. “This is an important milestone for Wing and drone delivery in the U.S.,” Woodworth adds. “It simply would not have been possible without the support of the public officials and the citizens of Frisco and Little Elm, and our merchant partners.”</p>
<p>Wing has been piloting deliveries in the DFW area since announcing the expansion late-last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global logistics and package delivery company UPS will leverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/23/jumia-reports-record-orders-and-revenue-but-investors-remain-unconvinced/">Jumia’s</a> network across Africa to grow its reach in the continent, following a new partnership announced today that gives it access to the e-commerce firm’s last mile delivery infrastructure.</p>
<p>This means that UPS customers can pick-up or drop-off packages for sending across the world at Jumia’s stations in Kenya, Morocco and Nigeria. Plans are underway to expand the partnership to Ghana and Ivory Coast, and the rest of its markets in Africa (Algeria, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda and South Africa) thereafter.</p>
<p>Jumia began building its logistics business seven years ago, owing to how fragmented logistics sector was and as a pathway to grow the number of orders made on its e-commerce marketplace beyond cities &#8212; by enabling customers in remote areas to make orders. In 2020, Jumia <a href="https://group.jumia.com/news/jumia-opens-logistics-service-to-third-parties">opened</a> its logistic marketplace to third parties after exclusively reserving it for e-commerce and food vendors operating on its marketplace.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293434" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“At the beginning of our journey (launch of the e-commerce platform), 10 years ago, logistics infrastructure was one of the most challenging aspects of our operating environment. This challenge was a catalyst for us to build an unparalleled logistics platform in Africa offering our sellers and consumers reliable, convenient and cost-effective delivery services,” said Jumia senior vice president logistics, Apoorva Kumar.</p>
<p>“Today, we are helping other businesses overcome these infrastructure challenges by giving them access to our logistics platform. We are delighted and humbled by the opportunity to partner up with UPS, a global logistics leader, to offer them last mile solutions in Africa. We view this as a validation of the strength of our logistics platform as well as an incentive to double down on our efforts to further enhance our services and build a world-class logistics business in Africa,” said Kumar.</p>
<p>In its logistics marketplace, Jumia uses about 600 partners for last-mile delivery, most of whom are small logistics firms. The e-commerce firm has 3,000 pickup stations spread across its 11 markets in Africa, all supported by a technology that “aggregates demand and matches it with supply capacity on the basis of several parameters like quality of service, reachability of network and cost of delivery.”</p>
<p>“UPS’s asset-light approach, like the Jumia partnership, offers a pathway for businesses to quickly and reliably connect to new customers around the world through our global network, potentially accelerating their revenue growth,” said UPS vice president of engineering and operations for Indian subcontinent, Middle East and Africa, Gregory Goba Ble.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s Mobile Premier League, or MPL, is in talks to raise capital from a number of investors including the crypto exchange FTX as the mobile gaming startup prepares to make a web3 push, three sources familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>An investment will mark a significant shift in the Bengaluru-headquartered startup’s future outlook as it gears up to expand its offerings in a new, buzzy category.</p>
<p>MPL operates over 60 mobile games including some that are sports-based, card-based, and fantasy. In recent weeks, it has informed some existing and new potential investors that it plans to launch play-to-earn and NFT-based games later this year, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the deliberations are ongoing and they are not authorized to speak to the press.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293382" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>MPL, which counts Sequoia Capital India and RTP Global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/indian-mobile-gaming-platform-mobile-premier-league-valued-at-945-million-in-95-million-fundraise/">among its existing backers</a>, has been looking to raise the new investment as an extension to its Series E round at a $2.5 billion valuation, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>The terms of the investment could change, the sources cautioned. FTX did not respond to a request for comment by press time. In a statement, an MPL spokesperson said: &#8220;as a company policy, we do not comment on speculations.&#8221;</p>
<p>MPL has amassed over 5 million monthly active “cash playing” users, it disclosed in a December investor presentation, reviewed by me. Its monthly average revenue per user stood at about $5, the presentation said.</p>
<p>In the presentation, MPL said it was building “the game distribution platform of tomorrow,” where over 500 million tournaments are already being played each month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A handful of established startups in India are beginning to explore opportunities in the web3 space. Dream11, MPL&#8217;s chief rival in India, is looking to lead a $100 million investment in NFT startup Rario, TechCrunch reported earlier. Cricket NFT startup FanCraze, which was recently valued at $500 million in a round led by Insight Partners, plans to expand into gaming, it has said.</p>
<p>Glance, an InMobi Group subsidiary that is backed by Google and Jio Platforms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/24/google-backed-glance-acquires-gaming-platform-gambit-in-nft-push/">acquired gaming platform Gambit last month</a> to introduce live game shows and NFT-based incentivization to its users.</p>
<p>The forthcoming investment in MPL would officially mark the arrival of FTX, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/01/despite-bumps-crypto-investment-starts-2022-with-a-roar/">valued at $32 billion</a>, into the Indian startup ecosystem, where it has so far largely been involved via the means of partnerships and sponsorships.</p>
<p>Coinbase, FTX’s rival, in contrast has invested about $150 million in Indian companies so far, including the top two local crypto exchanges, CoinSwitch Kuber and CoinDCX. The two Indian crypto exchanges compete with WazirX, which is owned by Binance.</p>
<p>The publicly listed firm Coinbase said on Monday that it plans to expand its local team in India to 1,000 people from 300 currently. &#8220;We are excited to tap into the dynamic Indian software talent to build out our products and will continue to invest heavily in our India hub,&#8221; wrote Coinbase co-founder and chief executive Brian Armstrong in a blog post.</p>
<p><em>The story was updated to add more context about Coinbase&#8217;s presence in India. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[While it may be too late for Better.com, here’s hoping others can learn from its mistakes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past four months, digital mortgage lender Better.com has conducted a mass layoff not once, but twice. The company also badly botched a mass layoff not once, but twice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, on December 1, Better.com <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">laid off about 900 employees</a> via a Zoom video call that ended up going viral. It was hardly the first company to lay people off over Zoom during a global pandemic. But it was the manner in which it was handled that offended so many. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO and co-founder Vishal Garg was universally criticized for being cold and unfeeling in his approach. He also added insult to injury by days later <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/12/03/better-com-ceo-attacks-laid-off-employees-blind-message-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly accusing affected workers</a></span><span class="s1"> of “stealing” from their colleagues and customers by being unproductive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, just one day </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CFO Kevin Ryan sent an email to employees saying that the company would have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/better-com-gets-750m-cash-infusion-in-new-agreement-with-its-spac-backers/">$1 billion on its balance sheet</a> by the end of that week. In the weeks following the layoffs, Garg “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-apologizes-to-current-employees-for-blundering-the-execution-of-mass-layoffs/">apologized</a>” and took a month-long “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-steps-back-as-employees-detail-how-he-led-by-fear/">break</a>,” employees detailed how he &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-steps-back-as-employees-detail-how-he-led-by-fear/">led by fear,</a>&#8221; and a number of senior executives and two board members resigned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, on March 8, the company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/08/better-com-employees-learned-of-layoffs-when-severance-checks-appeared-in-payroll-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laid off an estimated 3,000 of its remaining 8,000 employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. and India and “accidentally rolled out the severance pay slips too early.” Many workers reported that they initially found out by seeing a severance check in their Workday accounts — the payroll software the company uses. When execs realized their mistake, those employees said, they deleted the checks from some people’s Workday accounts. According to one affected employee who wished to remain anonymous, the severance checks arrived without any additional communication from the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we look back on these two layoffs, it&#8217;s clear that we can all likely agree on one thing: Better.com could have handled both incidents </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">better</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Obviously, layoffs are hard no matter the circumstance but sometimes necessary &#8212; especially in times like these, when we&#8217;re seeing<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/31/is-it-time-to-start-worrying-about-startup-layoffs/"> startups again considering layoffs</a> as a way to control cash consumption and attract new capital. We spoke to a trio of HR experts who offered some advice on how to make a layoff less painful for all involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an example to all companies of what not to do,&#8221; Lisa Calick, director of HR Advisory Services at <a href="https://wiss.com/firm-leadership-profile/lisa-calick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wiss &amp; Company</a>, said of Better.com’s handling of the situation. &#8220;Communication around involuntary terminations should always be handled with tact, respect and consideration for the affected individuals.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to my weekly fintech-focused column. I’ll be publishing this every Sunday, so in between posts, be sure to listen to the </span></i><a href="https://linktr.ee/Equitypod"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity podcast</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and hear </span></i><a href="https://twitter.com/alex"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Wilhelm</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natasha Mascarenhas</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and me riff on all things startups! And if you want to have this hit your inbox directly once it officially turns into a newsletter on May 1, sign up </span></i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech M&amp;A hasn’t been as robust as one might expect in recent months. So when <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> announced this week it was buying <strong><a href="https://www.nextcapital.com/">NextCapital</a></strong> – a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fintech company that provides automated advice to corporate retirement plan participants – my ears perked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NextCapital was a fintech company before fintech became cool. Founded in 2013 (or 2014 depending on the source), the Chicago-based company has raised over $82 million in funding over its lifetime from investors such as FinTech Collective and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oak HC/FT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to Crunchbase.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293318" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Luke Sarsfield, co-head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Employers are looking to provide their employees tailored solutions and customizable advice that can better support individual saving and investing needs to help improve retirement savings outcomes. We believe personalization represents the future of retirement savings and will drive the next wave of innovative retirement solutions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move is an interesting one as the investment giant has for years been strategically scooping up fintech companies. Again, according to Crunchbase, Goldman Sachs has </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/goldman-sachs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired 27 companies over time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last September, it announced it was </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/goldman-sachs-is-acquiring-buy-now-pay-later-fintech-greensky-for-2point2-billion-.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquiring buy now, buy later fintech GreenSky for $2.24 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an all-stock deal that was a reflection of its continued push into consumer finance. That deal closed last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of NextCapital, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses algorithms and automation to allow users to invest in retirement funds, Goldman didn’t say how much it was shelling out. But </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/29/goldman-sachs-is-buying-corporate-retirement-plan-robo-advisor-nextcapital.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that “the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquisition ranks among the top five asset management deals New York-based Goldman has done, according to the Financial Times.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s another example of an incumbent recognizing that it makes more sense to buy a company that has developed technology that it wants rather than building it out itself – a process that would take far longer and require more resources than a simple acquisition would.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early investor FinTech Collective said it backed NextCapital at a time when robo advisors were just coming to market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We felt that the underlying infrastructure supporting the shift from investment product to digital advice was a more durable, interesting space to be allocating capital to,” the firm said in a recent newsletter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also noted that Goldman’s intent to buy NextCapital “follows several moves by multiline incumbents (e.g. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan) to diversify into steadier income streams and to build out their own stacks in wealth and asset management.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Crunchbase data indicates that Goldman has also invested in over 900 companies, and led 343 of those investments. At the height of the dot.com boom in the first quarter of 2000, the bank had invested in a record 53 startups. In Q2 of 2000, that number dipped slightly to 46. And of course, by Q3, it had plunged to just 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its investment activity started picking up again starting in late 2018 and the bank backed 30 startups in the fourth quarter of 2019 alone. In Q1 of this year, it wrote checks to 17 companies, according to Crunchbase data, including to a few that TechCrunch has covered including corporate spend startup </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/21/corporate-spend-startup-ramp-closes-on-750-million-confirms-new-8-1b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, tech-enabled homebuilder </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/15/homebound-raises-75m-in-khosla-led-series-c/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebound</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Indian food delivery giant </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/08/swiggy-ipo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiggy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, for one, will be curious to see who else Goldman backs or buys in Q2.</span></p>
<h2>Fast slows its roll</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, The Information published </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-stripes-fast-horse-is-losing-the-one-click-checkout-race"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealing that <strong>Fast</strong>, which offers a one-click checkout service for online merchants, generated just $600,000 in revenue in 2021. Its biggest competitor, Bolt, raised “roughly 50 times that figure,” according to The Information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch last reported on Fast in January of 2021, when the startup raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $102 million Series B financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Stripe. Other backers include Index Ventures, Susa Ventures and Global Founders Capital. When it tried later in the year to raise a $100 million Series C financing at a valuation of over $1 billion, it didn’t find any takers, according to the Information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But wait, there’s more. The publication went on to report on April 1 (and no, it was not an April Fool’s joke), that Fast was </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripe-backed-fast-seeks-buyer-after-struggling-to-raise-capital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking a buyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after its failed fundraise attempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reportedly, the startup hired about 400 employees last year, and burned through about $10 million a month for most of that period. $600,000 divided by 12 = $50,000 in revenue a month. Spending $10 million a month when your product is only generating $50,000 in the same timeframe doesn’t seem smart. As my extremely talented colleague, Ingrid Lunden, put it: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the story for a lot of startups, but maybe particularly ironic when it&#8217;s a fintech startup built to process and make money…A lot of these payment companies are built precisely on economies of scale. Margins are super thin on the transactions, and the tech costs a lot to build and operate, which is why growth/reach/size matter.”</span></p>
<p>Add to this equation a CEO -– <a href="https://twitter.com/domm?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Domm Holland</a> – who is known for his &#8220;brash style&#8221; and had his share of controversy in Australia prior to starting Fast. Holland&#8217;s former startup Tow.com.au, which aimed to be &#8220;the Uber of towing,&#8221; failed in what at least one person described as a &#8220;disaster.&#8221; In February, NPR published <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/17/1081201040/domm-holland-fast-stripe">an article</a> noting that Holland&#8217;s previous venture was embroiled &#8220;in a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with the Australian state government over towing and impounding fees that led to the startup&#8217;s liquidation in 2018.&#8221;</p>
<p>It added that &#8220;the way Holland has rewritten and polished his past raises questions about how far the envelope can be pushed before crossing ethical lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, according to NPR, As Ilya Strebulaev, a professor of finance who studies the venture capital industry at Stanford University told NPR: &#8220;Failure is not a curse. But what&#8217;s important is how the failure happened.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what&#8217;s next for Fast? Will Holland resign? Will Bolt scoop it up? Or will some retailer just buy its technology? Or will it just die a slow death?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch reached out to Fast for comment. It had not responded by the time of writing</span></p>
<h2>Fundings across the globe</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding activity seemed to pick up some this week, although still not as crazy as it felt last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s just a trio that I covered:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got the scoop on <strong>Cross River Bank</strong> raising $620 million in a round co-led by Andreessen Horowitz – going from “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/cross-river-bank-lands-620m-at-a-3b-valuation-as-it-gears-toward-a-crypto-first-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiny to mighty with a $3B+ valuation and a crypto-first strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross River Bank is not just any bank. The Fort Lee, New Jersey-based </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/business/paycheck-protection-program-cross-river-bank.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">institution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also a technology infrastructure provider that quietly powers lending and payments for many of the fintechs that top VCs are also backing &#8212; a reverse of sorts of the more common fintech-powering-bank dynamic we&#8217;re used to. As fintech has exploded in recent years, so has Cross River Bank’s business — as well as investor interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Founder and CEO Gilles Gade told me the company, which powers the likes of Affirm and Coinbase, views crypto as front and center of its future efforts. Profitable since 2010, the bank is also ready for an international expansion.</span></p>
<p>Notably, David George, general partner of the Growth Fund at Andreessen Horowitz, told TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When Coinbase was first starting out and looking for a partner bank, many traditional financial institutions had blanket policies that prevented them from participating in crypto.&#8221; Cross River, on the other hand, had the foresight to lean into this new frontier and support Coinbase, and many other leading crypto companies, who are still happy partners to this day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also got the exclusive on a trio of Palantir alums who just </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/palantir-finance-alums-raise-25m-for-mosaic-in-founders-fund-peter-thiel-led-series-b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $25 million in a Series B led by Founders Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their new finance startup, <strong>Mosaic</strong>. This is interesting because both Palantir and Founders Fund were co-founded by Peter Thiel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mosaic is born out of our experience as CFOs and as domain experts over the past decade,” CEO Bijan Moallemi said. “We are trying to create a Strategic Finance category. If you think about the way that CFOs do their work, 80% of their time is mostly manual, right? It’s pulling down data from disparate systems, it’s doing ad hoc Excel formulas, it’s often one-off analyses. Only 20% of their time is more strategic, making an impact on the business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosaic wants to flip that ratio on its head. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, I also wrote about <strong>January</strong>, which wants to use technology to make debt collection a more humane and efficient process. That company just </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/january-raises-10m-to-be-a-tech-enabled-debt-collector/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $10 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep growing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started off by solving the really, really hard problem of how do you collect at scale in a really compliant manner or really compassionate but still really effective manner, and that enabled us to solve some of the larger problems in the industry,” CEO Jake Cavan told TechCrunch. “We have to stop treating individuals like criminals and start making the system work, because debt isn’t going away.”</span></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s more that either my awesome colleagues wrote or that I thought were interesting but just couldn&#8217;t get to:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.yondercard.com/">Yonder</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>,</strong> a UK-based fintech founded in 2021, raised </span>£20M<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($26M) in a round led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northzone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">LocalGlobe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bring its lifestyle credit card to market. The company says its vision is to “rebuild customers’ relationship with credit.” Its three co-founders are </span><a href="https://www.clearscore.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearscore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alumni, who have pulled in talent from (Transfer)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monzo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build out Yonder’s team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Tim Chong came up with the concept soon after he moved to the UK from Australia and attempted to apply for a credit card. Despite having a “solid” credit history back home, the best he could qualify for was an Amex with a ‘child-safe’ credit limit and hefty fees. Yonder’s first aim is to solve the problem of access to credit cards for expats and anyone with a thin credit file, with a sign-up process and credit suitability evaluation based on transaction history from daily spending habits instead of relying entirely on traditional credit checks, which Chong feels are discriminatory.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever company employees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. and U.K. use the card, their carbon footprint is offset automatically. For example, for every £1 or $1.50 spent, CarbonPay says it will offset 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide at no extra cost. The company keeps track of carbon footprints through a partnership with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustainability-as-a-Service company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ecolytiq.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later this year, CarbonPay plans to unveil another business card option and personal card offering</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our own Romain Dillet reported on how ​​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa surprised the European fintech industry last year when it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/visa-to-acquire-open-banking-platform-tink-for-more-than-2-billion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it would acquire </span><a href="https://tink.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for €1.8 billion ($2.15 billion at the time of the deal). <strong>Klarna</strong> now wants to compete directly with Tink with a new business unit that has its own brand — </span><a href="https://www.kosma.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna Kosma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Tink, Klarna offers an open banking application programming interface (API) with Klarna Kosma. Tink and Klarna are also both headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. There are other open banking API companies, such as </span><a href="https://truelayer.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrueLayer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://plaid.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And it’s been a competitive space as Visa also tried to acquire Plaid but that deal </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fell through</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this new strategy, Klarna is essentially saying that it’s open for business. If you’re building a financial product and need to interact with bank accounts, you have one more option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2022/03/31/adyen-payments-banking-strategic-expansion-credit-finance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">payments giant <strong>Adyen</strong> on March 31 announced that it is moving into providing banking services &#8212; making it a Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alex Wilhelm and I talked about how this is another example of how so many companies are realizing the value of providing infrastructure. In this case, Adyen says it is launching a </span><span class="s1">suite of embedded financial products that will allow platforms and marketplaces to create tailored financial experiences for their users, including small business owners and individual merchants. As Alex put it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe did this but now everyone is coming for banking infra, I think, as a way to drive more enterprise software revenues and get away from consumer incomes.”</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, fellow fintech enthusiast Ron Shevlin in February summed it up nicely in a recent <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2022/02/22/embedded-finance-is-fueling-a-25-billion-banking-as-a-service-baas-opportunity/?sh=36df44d55d59">Forbes piece</a>, writing that &#8220;the rise of interest in banking as a service is the result of the growing embedded finance trend.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other infrastructure news…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ross-border payments platform dLocal is one of the most notable Latin American startups in recent history — the company became Uruguay’s first unicorn in 2020 and went public on the Nasdaq in 2021. DLocal’s founders had first launched AstroPay, another digital payments platform that now has over five million users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, dLocal and AstroPay co-founder Sergio Fogel has teamed up with AstroPay’s former head of product, Gonzalo Strauss, to launch another fintech out of Montevideo, Uruguay, called </span><a href="https://www.datanomik.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Datanomik</strong></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Igor Khmel is CEO of SaveChain, a new neobank for underbanked people globally to open U.S. bank accounts. Khmel tells TechCrunch that while SaveChain is still in its infancy (the company plans to launch its app by July), he wants to use its technology to help Ukrainians now by powering a new fintech-humanitarian initiative called <strong>HelpUkrainedirect</strong>, which provides &#8216;Temporary Basic Income&#8217; to Ukrainian refugees via direct donations in crypto &amp; USD. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through its initiative </span><a href="https://helpukrainedirect.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HelpUkraineDirect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (HUD), the company says its goal is to provide Ukrainians with direct financial relief, leveraging blockchain technology and existing banking and volunteer infrastructure to pioneer a ‘Temporary Basic Income’ (TBI) scheme for refugees via direct donor-to-refugee money distribution. The aim is to provide hard-pressed individuals with $100/month for 3-6 months, according to Khmel. Crypto and tax-deductible donations can be made at </span><a href="https://helpukrainedirect.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://HelpUkraineDirect.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla reported Saturday that it delivered more than 305,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter, a record-breaking figure that was inline with analyst expectations even as production suffered due to supply chain constraints and COVID-related factory shutdowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was an <em>exceptionally</em> difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions &amp; China zero Covid policy,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1510288141495640070?s=20&amp;t=3OX252HVBmYBUqXXFyhiTA">CEO Elon Musk tweeted Saturday</a>. &#8220;Outstanding work by Tesla team &amp; key suppliers saved the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla reported that it <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-vehicle-production-deliveries-and-date-financial-results-webcast-first-quarter">produced 305,407 vehicles</a> and delivered 310,048 vehicles in the first quarter. The vast majority of vehicles produced and delivered were Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. Tesla delivered 295,324 Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. It delivered 14,724 Model S and Model X vehicles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The delivery figures were in line or beat analysts expectation depending on the polled group. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv showed expectations of 308,836 vehicle deliveries while those polled by Factset anticipated 317,000. However, production was down slightly from 305,840 in the previous quarter due to factory shutdowns and supply chain issues.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s first-quarter delivery and production report comes amid increasing pressure in China where a surge in COVID-19 cases has prompted the government to issue lockdowns . Tesla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/28/tesla-idles-production-gigafactory-shanghai-covid/">idled production at its factory</a> Shanghai twice in March. Tesla&#8217;s Gigafactory Shanghai <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">produces about 2,000 vehicles daily, mostly Model Ys and Model 3s for Chinese consumers and the  European market. </span></p>
<p>Tesla has managed scaled its production compared to the same quarter last year as new factories come online. In the first quarter of 2021, Tesla produced just over 180,000 vehicles and delivered nearly 185,000 vehicles. Production should continue to ramp now that Tesla&#8217;s new factory in Berlin has opened.</p>
<p>Tesla also said Saturday that it will report first-quarter earnings April 20 after market closes. A live Q&amp;A with Tesla management will follow at 5:30 pm ET.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. Global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">grew 19% in 2021</a> to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year over year to reach $295 billion.</p>
<p>Today’s consumers now spend more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2292516" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">generated over $100 million</a> in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps to try, too.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Apple this week <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=grjqafts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it will begin to allow a subset of applications sold on its App Store to link to an external website where users can create or manage their accounts with the app developer. The change to Apple’s App Store Review guidelines only applies to what Apple calls “reader” apps — meaning, apps designed primarily to provide access to some sort of digital content, like magazines, books, audio, music or video. Apple’s plans were first announced last September in the context of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/">the tech giant’s settlement with a Japanese regulator,</a> the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), and had been set to arrive sometime in early 2022.</p>
<p>The company had earlier said the changes would apply globally to all reader apps on the App Store when they went live, but had not provided an exact launch date.</p>
<p>Specifically, Apple instructs developers to apply for something it calls the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/reader-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">External Link Account Entitlement</a> in order to provide this functionality in their own apps. Developers must apply for the entitlement and then be approved in order to make the change.</p>
<p>Apple has been leveraging the use of entitlements whenever it&#8217;s been pushed by lawmakers or regulators to update its App Store rules in an area. By doing so, it&#8217;s still in compliance with the letter of the law, but it places an additional burden on those developers who want to take advantage of the new options &#8212; like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=jmps5hyj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dating apps in the Netherlands</a>, which are now permitted by law to use third-party billing, for example. Apple could easily update its App Store rules to document that this sort of new functionality is now permitted in select use cases, but it still wants to exert control over the whole process and ensure developers who don&#8217;t meet the requirements slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s disappointing to see Apple continuing to fight so hard against this larger turning of the tide for its app marketplace &#8212; even getting itself entangled in expensive lawsuits like the one with Epic Games &#8212; instead of having earlier simplified commissions across the board with a sizable &#8212; but still manageable &#8212; price cut. One has to wonder if Apple could have headed off developers&#8217; and regulators&#8217; concerns by taking a different path from the complicated carve-outs it has proceeded to embrace. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/apple-3-trillion-market-value.html#:~:text=Apple%20is%20still%20worth%20more,share%20before%20closing%20at%20%24182.01." target="_blank" rel="noopener">multitrillion-dollar company</a> can afford to make less money from users&#8217; App Store purchases. And it could find a variety of ways to monetize its app developer ecosystem differently in the future. It seems Apple is already<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-30/apple-is-working-on-project-to-bring-financial-services-in-house?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> looking into bringing</a> payment processing technology in-house in a bid to generate more revenue and reduce reliance on fintech partners. While this effort would impact all parts of Apple&#8217;s larger business, it could also help Apple handle the App Store losses that arose from lowered commissions.</p>

<p>March 31, 2022 was the deadline for the submission of amicus briefs supporting Apple in the Epic appeal. Among the new signers were those from former national security officials, including Vice Admiral Mike McConnell, former DNI and NSA director, and two former CIA directors, Gen. Hayden and John Brennan. The officials agree with Apple&#8217;s positioning that its commission structure is fair and allows it to create a &#8220;safe and secure ecosystem.&#8221; What&#8217;s interesting, however, is that Roblox also filed a brief to support Apple&#8217;s cause. A platform maker itself, albeit one that hosts online games not mobile apps, it&#8217;s likely aware of the impact of app market regulations on its own business.</p>
<p>In particular, Roblox pointed to the need for platforms to set the standards for, review and approve software, user-generated content and apps that appear on platforms. It stressed how Apple&#8217;s App Review system benefits all apps in the Apple ecosystem, including its own mobile Roblox app, by providing a level of safety and security. While the company didn&#8217;t say Apple should be protected from all antitrust scrutiny, it made a solid argument against removing the platform model entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Wrote Roblox:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>None of this is to say that Apple necessarily has it right whereas other platform models have it wrong, or that all decisions Apple might make regarding its App Store platform and related policies are sacrosanct or should be de facto protected from antitrust scrutiny. But the key point is that Apple’s model does provide real benefits to security and privacy. No platform is going to be perfect in its efforts to rid an ecosystem of bad actors, but it is core to Roblox’s beliefs that real, tangible results can be obtained where there is an enhanced focus on safety and security. The evidence at trial did not show that all of these benefits necessarily can be retained while eliminating the platform model that has allowed for them. Roblox’s experience, consistent with the evidence presented here, is that these particular procompetitive aspects of the App Store are real and intertwined with the way Apple structures its platform. The district court was right not to cast them aside as mere “pretext,” and neither should this Court.</p></blockquote>

<p>Russia in mid-March officially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/14/instagram-is-now-blocked-in-russia/">banned Instagram</a> in order to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/russia-instagram-block/">tighten</a> its grip on the country&#8217;s citizens&#8217; ability to access uncensored information about the Russia-Ukraine war. But the ban has only resulted in sending another app just like Instagram to No. 1 on the Russian App Store. On March 29 and 30, a Russian app called <a href="https://join-fiesta.web.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fiesta</a> became the top free iPhone app in the country after having first launched on November 25, 2021. The first time it ever charted in the top free apps in the country was on March 26.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a lot of information about Fiesta, though it appears to be Russian-made. Its website doesn&#8217;t offer much information beyond what the app looks like and a form to join the beta. The site also displays photos of the app and links out to Fiesta&#8217;s social accounts, including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/app.fiesta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Fiesta26305236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> &#8212; the latter where it&#8217;s never posted. The app greatly resembles Instagram, but it also offers features for finding and joining local events, which differentiates it.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://sensortower.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensor Tower&#8217;s</a> preliminary estimates, Fiesta has now seen nearly 200,000 installs to date &#8212; most of which occurred this past week. From March 27 to March 30, the app saw around 184,000 installs &#8212; or more than 30 times the 6,000 installs it saw in the prior period from March 23 to March 26.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/31/apple-business-essentials-puts-device-management-and-support-in-reach-of-smbs/">launched</a> Apple Business Essentials</strong>, designed to help smaller businesses manage devices without necessarily having IT expertise in-house.</li>
<li><strong>Apple released iOS 15.4.1, iPadOS 15.4.1 and macOS 12.3.1</strong>, which includes a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/31/apple-releases-ios-15-4-1-battery-issues-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fix</a> for battery issues on iPhone and iPad and <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apple-emergency-update-fixes-zero-days-used-to-hack-iphones-macs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two zero-days</a> that &#8220;may have been actively exploited.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Apple is said to be building its own payments technology</strong> to reduce its reliance on partners. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-30/apple-is-working-on-project-to-bring-financial-services-in-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Bloomberg</a>, the project is dubbed &#8220;Breakout&#8221; in-house and indicates the company&#8217;s interest in expanding into fintech beyond Apple Pay, Apple Card and the transactions it processes across the App Store and iTunes.</li>
<li><strong>Apple&#8217;s Senior VP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, <a href="https://www.iphonehacks.com/2022/03/apple-exec-explains-delayed-ios-auto-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded to a user&#8217;s email</a></strong>asking why there was a delay in receiving iOS software updates automatically. Surprisingly, the exec answered, explaining that Apple incrementally rolls out new iOS updates by <em>&#8220;first making them available for those that explicitly seek them out in Settings, and then 1-4 weeks later (after we’ve received feedback on the update) ramp up to rolling out devices with auto-update enabled.&#8221;</em> (So, I guess if you want updates sooner, go hit up Settings!)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Platforms: Google</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Play&#8217;s new <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10281818" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billing payments policy</a> began on April 1</strong>. The company had announced back in 2020 that developers would need to come into compliance with the policy that requires apps selling digital goods and services to use Google Play&#8217;s own billing system. Unless developers were approved for an extension, they will no longer be able to submit app updates until they&#8217;re in compliance, barring any critical security issues. On June 1, 2022, non-compliant apps will be removed from Google Play.</li>
<li><strong>It looks like Google is working on its own AirTag detection features</strong>. Google Play Services 22.12.13 <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/03/29/android-bluetooth-tracker-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">includes code referring to</a> &#8220;unfamiliar device alerts&#8221; and &#8220;unfamiliar tag detection notifications.&#8221;</li>

<li><strong>Barcelona-based Glovo is <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/03/31/this-food-delivery-app-is-taking-orders-across-23-war-torn-cities-in-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">running its food and grocery delivery app</a> in Ukraine as a nonprofit</strong>. The company has 2,000+ couriers in the war-torn country running groceries, restaurant meals and prescriptions to people in need. Glovo said it decided to reopen in cities after finding some couriers were already donating their time to ad hoc groups that were working to help keep supplies flowing; this way, those couriers can get paid for that work.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snap announced its <a href="https://snappartnersummit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual summit</a> will be held on April 28</strong>. Last year, the company introduced its AR Spectacles (AR glasses). This time around, we&#8217;re expecting more AR-focused updates for the Snapchat app.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fintech</h3>
<ul>

The startup also appears to be redesigning the app to make the UPI transactions intuitive. The support will put Slice in competition with Walmart-backed PhonePe and Google Pay.</li>
<li><strong>Robinhood&#8217;s stock popped 25% on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/29/robinhoods-stock-pops-25-on-news-of-extended-trading-hours/">news of its support</a> for extended trading hours</strong>. Previously, the app offered trading from 9 AM ET to 6 PM ET — 30 minutes before the market opened and two hours after its close. The app’s new trading hours are now 7 AM ET to 8 PM ET.</li>

<li><strong>Data.ai (formerly App Annie) <a href="https://www.data.ai/en/insights/data-ai-news/data-ai-releases-app-iq-advanced-taxonomy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a new product</a> called App IQ</strong>, which offers competitive intelligence about app features, from monetization methods to social features, so businesses can identify both competitive threats and partnership opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Government &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>In its battle with Dutch regulators, Apple has now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/31/apple-acm-antitrust-offer-tweak/">dropped</a> its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=jmps5hyj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirement</a> to require developers to create a separate app binary</strong> in order to take advantage of the new antitrust order that permits third-party payments in dating apps. The regulator had earlier said the requirement was an &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/14/acm-fines-apple-again/">unreasonable</a>&#8221; demand on Apple&#8217;s part. The change means developers can use either the StoreKit External Purchase Entitlement or the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement to sell their services through a payment system other than Apple&#8217;s own. Apple&#8217;s refusal to meet the antitrust guidelines has seen the company rack up 10 €5 million fines, totaling €50 million to date.</li>
<li><strong>Also in the Netherlands, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-29/apple-faces-multibillion-euro-dutch-class-action-over-app-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple is now facing</a> a multibillion-euro lawsuit</strong> led by nonprofit Consumer Competition Claims Foundation that alleges Apple is using anti-competitive practices to overcharge consumers and restrict their payment options for in-app purchases. Bloomberg said the suit claims the harms add up to nearly $5.5 billion USD.</li>
<li><strong>India&#8217;s Competition Commission probe <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/cci-probe-finds-googles-play-store-billing-guidelines-unfair-and-discriminatory/articleshow/90550596.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found Google Play&#8217;s billing guidelines</a> are &#8220;unfair and discriminatory,&#8221;</strong> suggesting that India could be the next market to regulate app stores. The regulator also examined allegations Google used &#8220;search manipulation&#8221; to push Google Pay.</li>
<li><strong>The U.S. Dept. of Justice <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doj-backs-antitrust-bill-targeting-amazon-google-apple-11648519385" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voiced its support</a> for the antitrust bill (the American Innovation and Choice Online Act) targeting Apple, Google and Amazon</strong>. In a letter to the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the DoJ said it views &#8220;the rise of dominant platforms as presenting a threat to open markets and competition, with risks for consumers, businesses, innovation, resiliency, global competitiveness, and our democracy.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security &amp; Privacy</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>It’s YC week, and while I love to question how the accelerator’s impact is evolving in today’s climate, there’s always a lot to learn about hundreds of founders coming together and debuting their businesses to the world. I, alongside some of my favorites on the TechCrunch and TechCrunch+ team, covered Y Combinator Winter 2022 Demo Day with a series of posts:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/demo-days-definitely-amplify-a-brand-but-not-the-one-youd-think/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">Demo days definitely amplify a brand, but not the one you’d think </a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2291802&amp;preview=true">Everything you need to know about YC Winter 2022 Demo Day, part 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we’re done, though, I want to leave you with a few takeaways I had after listening to hundreds of pitches. Here’s what 411 Demo Day pitches will teach you about startups:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2291566" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/29/y-combinator-india-winter-2022/">India is all about fintech:</a> </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">India was the most represented country, other than the United States in the Winter 2022 batch. For what it’s worth, more than 191 companies in India have been funded through the Y Combinator accelerator, with nearly half — half! —  of those companies accepted in the last 12 months. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demo Day isn’t for funding, anymore: </strong>During Equity this week, we chatted about how demo days have evolved in utility, and if the performance in and of itself is outdated. I won’t ruin our eventual conclusion, but I will mention some illustrious YC data. This year, YC said that it backs startups at any stage for its accelerator, and that more than half of the companies raised money prior to acceptance. To me that means that the accelerator isn’t really for the pre-seed company seeking its first check, but for any company that wants access to the YC network.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/29/yc-demo-day-competition/">Competition is inevitable:</a> </strong>We noticed that a number of startups basically directly compete with each other in this season’s batch, which isn’t a new trend but perhaps a more noteworthy one as the accelerator scales. Most early-stage investors I speak to try to avoid any semblance of conflict of interest, so YC backing companies in the same geography, with identical business models and founding years is contrarian in a way. It seems like the accelerator has avoided any public tensions so far by separating similar startups from each other — but with around a 2% acceptance rate, one has to wonder how similar bets are determined.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did an earlier version of this column in September, titled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/04/what-377-y-combinator-pitches-will-teach-you-about-startups/">&#8220;What 377 Y Combinator pitches will teach you about startups.”</a> Months later, the accelerator has grown its expanse, with nearly half of its companies based outside the United States and new representation from New Zealand, Sudan, Uganda and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>I’ll remind you all, as I always do, that YC — similar to any singular institution — isn’t entirely illustrative of the next wave of decision-makers and leaders within startups. Its growing check size, for example, knocked out a whole slew of funders who once poached deal flow from demo day. And when it comes to diversity, the accelerator dipped in support for some underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll look at an edtech round in India, getting rid of pro rata and Cross River Bank&#8217;s atypical raise. As always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">following me on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://natasha.substack.com/">subscribing to my personal blog.</a></p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p>Classplus! As our own Manish Singh points out, “at a time when so many edtech firms in India are attempting to cut their reliance on teachers, a Noida-based startup that is helping teachers and creators operate, manage and sell courses to students <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/28/indias-classplus-raises-70-million-to-help-teachers-and-creators-expand-their-reach/">has raised $70 million in a new financing round.”</a> The startup, now valued at $570 million, is just four years old.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s why it’s important: </strong>Offline coaching — in which tutors go in-person to teach students on a variety of subjects — is still very popular in India, however it’s limited by geography. The pandemic, and a broader digitization across the globe, has made some teachers pursue online opportunities to grow their larger businesses. Classplus’ ability to raise money means that urban India has enough demand to be a venture-backable market.</p>

<h2>Let’s get rid of pro rata</h2>
<p>Investors Vijay Chattha and Jay Kapoor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/vsc-startup-fund-climate/">who co-founded a venture firm</a> spin out from a PR company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/22/its-time-to-hold-investors-accountable-and-abolish-pro-rata/">recently wrote an op-ed</a> arguing that VC should abolish pro rata. The duo drew from a portfolio survey and found that investors rarely provide value-add beyond 90 days from the signed term sheet. “At that point, the investor’s engagement is limited to their attendance at the quarterly board meeting — and that’s the lead investor,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/22/its-time-to-hold-investors-accountable-and-abolish-pro-rata/">the op-ed continues.</a></p>
<p>The investors thus think that their peers shouldn’t invoke contractually negotiated pro-rata rights if they aren’t involved in the business, since “their mere presence on the cap table disincentivizes other VCs from working harder for their founders.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Here’s why it’s important:</strong> Chattha and Kapoor’s argument is contrarian, because it bets on investors changing their habits at the cost of their own returns. However, I like that it’s asking investors to raise their bar on involvement and influence once they land that coveted cap table spot. It’s easy to give up pro rata in a startup that is struggling, but what about needing to constantly prove yourself to your highest valued company? Incentive alignment for days, if you ask me.</p>

<h2>From tiny to mighty, real fast</h2>
<p>Cross River Bank has raised $620 million in funding at a valuation north of $3 billion. The company provides technology infrastructure to venture-backed lending and payments, making the raise somewhat of a double bet on fintech’s boom.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s why it’s important:</strong> Fintech startups raised $121.6 billion last year — up 153% year-over-year in terms of global VC deal value, however, as Mary Ann pointed out, it’s atypical to pour millions of dollars into a traditional bank. Andreessen Horowitz general partner David George explained why he is so interested in the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When Coinbase was first starting out and looking for a partner bank, many traditional financial institutions had blanket policies that prevented them from participating in crypto,” George told TechCrunch. “Cross River, on the other hand, had the foresight to lean into this new frontier and support Coinbase, and many other leading crypto companies, who are still happy partners to this day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2>Saying goodbye to Q1</h2>
<p id="speakable-summary">What a <em>week</em>.</p>
<p>If you were plugged in to the startup news cycle recently, you&#8217;ve been busy. Y Combinator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/29/our-favorite-startups-from-ycs-winter-2022-demo-day-part-1/">dropped hundreds of new startups</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/our-favorite-startups-from-ycs-winter-2022-demo-day-part-2/">onto the market</a>, Instacart&#8217;s repricing continued to reverberate, and it feels like we&#8217;re discovering that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/31/is-it-time-to-start-worrying-about-startup-layoffs/">some parts of the startup market are already in a period of correction</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2293237" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s starting to feel like a summary of the first quarter: A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/28/are-we-seeing-evidence-of-a-startup-slowdown/">hot early-stage market</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/01/late-stage-software-startups-might-be-in-the-most-valuation-trouble/">late-stage startup climate in a cooling period</a>. We&#8217;ll better understand the full Q1 picture when we get all the incoming venture capital data, but early marks do match that summary.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ahead is going to prove utterly fascinating. Q2 will see a host of startups need to raise new capital, and many will find the investing landscape utterly foreign compared to when they last looked for capital. What will that force? Will unicorns tap venture debt? Will we see a parade of down-rounds? Smaller inside deals to bolster runway? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Listening between the cracks, the public conversation about a startup pullback may actually be somewhat late. If it was happening internally earlier in the year then we might have picked up on it.</p>
<p>But what we can say is that the news hurricane of the last few weeks has been clarifying. From falling tech stocks to retreating unicorns and infinite early-stage hype, we are in a strange period, but one that I think we can now put a bow atop and move on from. Here&#8217;s to Q2.</p>
<h2>TechCrunch+</h2>
<p>This little newsletter launched out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">my daily column for TechCrunch+</a>, TechCrunch&#8217;s reporting that sits behind our paywall. Launched a few years ago under the Extra Crunch brand, our experiment into the subscription media space has been a fascinating journey.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1505991799889965062">we announced</a> that I would take over as Editor in Chief of TechCrunch+, something that I am very excited about. And frankly more than a little humbled, but saying so is past cliche at this point so we can move on.</p>
<p>A few notes on what&#8217;s ahead seem fair at this juncture, as The Exchange&#8217;s regular entries have been a staple of the TechCrunch+ posting flow since late 2019, which means that you all are veterans of the project. Thank you, by the way.</p>
<p>TechCrunch+ has reached material scale, which means we have a strong cohort of subscribers, hard evidence that we&#8217;re doing something worthwhile and that the larger TechCrunch community is willing to endorse that work. The even better news is that we&#8217;re investing in TechCrunch+ this year, with more staff and lots of neat ideas ahead. Our goal is to not only do more reporting and writing, but also to widen our lens somewhat to ensure a broader content mix.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why <a href="https://twitter.com/jacqmelinek/status/1505913013076955136"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Jacquelyn </span>is aboard</a> to write about the fascinating, infuriating, and quickly evolving world of crypto. We&#8217;ll have more names to announce shortly in other areas, including the areas where I have traditionally written for you.</p>
<p>That TechCrunch+ is not only alive, but growing is great news if you care about startups. One very nice thing about having a subscription service as part of a publication is that you can afford &#8212; literally &#8212; to go a bit more niche than you otherwise might be able to. This means that The Exchange has been able to, at times, focus down to a single startup topic and spend endless time gutting through its mechanics. Our work covering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/data-show-2021-was-a-bonkers-record-setting-year-for-venture-capital/">the 2021 venture boom</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/saving-not-spending-is-the-new-hotness-in-fintech/">the 2020 consumer fintech explosion</a>, and 2022&#8217;s startup slowdown that we mentioned above are a few examples.</p>
<p>TechCrunch is building this year. And part of that work is accelerating TechCrunch+. I think I am supposed to end this with some sort of pitch, right? I&#8217;ll try: Give <a href="https://techcrunch.com/techcrunchplus">TechCrunch+</a> a try this year when it makes sense. When the right article makes you curse the paywall, I hope that we earn your attention, and, well, money, this year.</p>
<p>Hugs, be kind to one another, and I&#8217;ll talk to you Monday. &#8212; Alex</p>
